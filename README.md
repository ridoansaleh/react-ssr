# Info 
I was cloned this repository from [@alexnm](https://github.com/alexnm) just for learning purpose. You could see the original repository [here](https://github.com/alexnm/react-ssr/). 

# Getting Start
Clone the repo by
```git clone https://github.com/ridoansaleh/react-ssr```

Install dependencies with
```npm i```

Run dev mode with
```npm run dev```

Now open the browser and navigate to `http://localhost:2048` and you get your server rendered React app. You can inspect the page source and see that the html coming from your local server has all the nodes defined in the React app.
